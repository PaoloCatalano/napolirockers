        <h3>Collaborations</h3>
        In February 2010 Napoli Rockers meets Rod Taylor in his only Italian
        tour date, on Officina99 stage. In September 2012 the band records, with
        the legendary producer Dennis Bovell, an arrangement of “You’re No Good”
        by Ken Boothe, produced by Salvatore Scognamiglio. They share with
        Dennis the stage the following year, in a concert in Largo Banchi Nuovi,
        in the heart of Naples. In these four years Napoli Rockers musicians
        have also the opportunity to work individually and in other projects
        along with Reggae Music. They approach the Italian scene, and meet
        Micheal Prophet, Earl 16, Martin Campbell and Afrikan Simba in their
        tour dates in South Italy. In the following autumn the band starts a
        season of experimentation and private recording. The rhythmic section of
        the Syndicate keeps on performing live in Naples and nearby, and works
        with the veteran selecter Aba Shanti. In September 2015 Napoli Rockers’
        full band joins together for a unique show in Italy, where they partner
        the Congos’ singer Cedric Myton together with R.Zee Jackson, in a
        concert at the Hermitage of Camaldoli in Naples. The following autumn
        sees them making studio sessions for Youthman Sant’Antonio Rockers’, the
        band’s partner and vocalist, independent label. In 2016 Napoli rockers
        publishes its first official single “Throughout the Moolight” featuring
        Ken Boothe. Nowadays Napoli Rockers has increased the number of
        musicians in the band, and it’s working in order to release a new
        single, and to record a whole new album.
