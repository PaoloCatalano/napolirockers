          In February 2010 Napoli Rockers meets Rod Taylor in his only Italian
          tour date, on Officina99 stage. In September 2012 the band records,
          with the legendary producer Dennis Bovell, an arrangement of “You’re
          No Good” by Ken Boothe, produced by Salvatore Scognamiglio. They share
          with Dennis the stage the following year, in a concert in Largo Banchi
          Nuovi, in the heart of Naples. In these four years Napoli Rockers
          musicians have also the opportunity to work individually and in other
          projects along with Reggae Music. They approach the Italian scene, and
          meet Micheal Prophet, Earl 16, Martin Campbell and Afrikan Simba in
          their tour dates in South Italy. In the following autumn the band
          starts a season of experimentation and private recording. The rhythmic
          section of the Syndicate keeps on performing live in Naples and
          nearby, and works with the veteran selecter Aba Shanti. In September
          2015 Napoli Rockers’ full band joins together for a unique show in
          Italy, where they partner the Congos’ singer Cedric Myton together
          with R.Zee Jackson, in a concert at the Hermitage of Camaldoli in
          Naples. The following autumn sees them making studio sessions for
          Youthman Sant’Antonio Rockers’, the band’s partner and vocalist,
          independent label. In 2016 Napoli rockers publishes its first official
          single “Throughout the Moolight” featuring Ken Boothe. Nowadays Napoli
          Rockers has increased the number of musicians in the band, and it’s
          working in order to release a new single, and to record a whole new
          album.
