        Napoli Rockers is a musical collective born in 2010 from a group of
        young Neapolitan musicians, united in order to share their deep love for
        Reggae music together with its true message: bring voice to those who
        have never had it, and claim unity, peace and justice.

        The band identifies its main influence in the Roots Rockers tradition:
        through a hard work of study and musical research, the band made itself
        capable to share stages and recording sessions with producers and
        personalities of reggae music worldwide.
